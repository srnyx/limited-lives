# Messages for general plugin usage
plugin:
  # These are placeholders that can be used in any message in this file
  # This is extremely useful for things like prefixes, color schemes, and more
  # Using a global placeholder is just like any other placeholder! Simply surround the placeholder name with "%" (ex: "%prefix%")
  # WARNING: Global placeholders can conflict with local placeholders! Please be wary when creating your own global placeholder(s)!
  global-placeholders: # It's recommended to keep all the default global placeholders (prefix, p, s, pe, se)
    prefix: "&6&lLIVES &8&l| &e" # Prefix for the plugin, typically used in the beginning of most messages
    p: "&e" # Base color for non-error messages
    s: "&6" # Highlight color for non-error messages
    pe: "&c" # Base color for error messages
    se: "&4" # Highlight color for error messages

  # These are the different splitters for messages/placeholders
  splitters:
    # This is the splitter for the JSON components. Default: "@@"
    json: "@@"
    # This is the splitter for placeholders with parameters. Default: "=="
    placeholder: "=="
